## AKNOWLEDGE THAT...
you will have to make everything else on you own, such as:
* default accessories system, like myworld's

# Credits
* Plusgiant5 for helping.
* ShownApe for his [hatdrop](https://github.com/ShownApe/hatdrop) script having a couple good concepts that I used. also digitality's [hatdrop](https://github.com/PresidentAnvil/hatdrop) for the same reason
