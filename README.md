# loadlua's Hatdrop Reanimation
feel free to use these in your hubs, but please credit me! this github will contain all the premade FE Scripts i've made with hatdrop. if you've got any questions, hmu on discord (loadlua)

# Known Issues
* Flickering

  Partially resolved, waiting for a better executor to help debug.

* Jitter

  Jitterless soon dw :(

## AKNOWLEDGE THAT...
you will have to make everything else on you own, such as:
* default accessories system, like myworld's
* fling until i find out how to not be shit at programming

# Credits
* MyWorld for supposedly coming up with using FPDH
* ShownApe for his [hatdrop](https://github.com/ShownApe/hatdrop) script having a couple good concepts that I used
