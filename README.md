## <p align="center">Known Issues</p>
- Shoulder Accesories tend to not drop. This might be because of the orientation the character is in on death. I'll look into it soon.

## <p align="center">AKNOWLEDGE THAT...</p>
you will have to make everything else on you own, such as:
- default accessories system, like myworld's

# <p align="center">Credits</p>
