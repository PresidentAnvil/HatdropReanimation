# loadlua's Hatdrop Reanimation
feel free to use these in your hubs, but please credit me! this github will contain all the premade FE Scripts i've made with hatdrop. if you've got any questions, hmu on discord (loadlua)

## AKNOWLEDGE THAT...
you will have to make everything else on you own, such as:
* default accessories system, like myworld's
* more idk

# Credits
* MyWorld for supposedly coming up with using FPDH
* ShownApe for his [hatdrop](https://github.com/ShownApe/hatdrop) script having a couple good concepts that I used
